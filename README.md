# mut8

This is a sandbox, based around the physics engine [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D),
in which creatures evolve to run as fast as possible - by defualt.

The project can be ran [here.](https://rawgit.com/tobq/mut8/master/index.html)

### Controls:
* right arrow (→): Speed up simulation by 1s/s
* left arrow (←): Slow down simulation by 1s/s
* up arrow (↑): Speed up by a factor of 2
* down arrow (↓): Slow down by a factor of 2

###### Notes:
* speed → 0 = pause.
* The graphs yellow and cyan line represent average and max speeds, respectively.
